# JavaScript/TypeScript Development Environment

> ⚠️ THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS

> My presentation notes and resources for establishing a competent JS/TS
> development environment aimed at new programmers

**Goal**: Introduce relatively new developers interested in JavaScript and
TypeScript to ways that they can optimize their development workflows.

One of the best investments a programmer can make is in their own development
environment. Successful programmers are constantly tweaking and tuning their
development environment to **work for them**. Saving 5 seconds on a task
executed 50 times daily, like code formatting, could save you ~18 hours/year.
Multiply this times the number of automations you can find in your development
workflow and you can find yourself literally saving months of effort.

**TL;DR**: If you're a programmer, **invest in yourself**.

Much of this series is centered around VSCode and its extensions, but the
concepts can generally be applied to other text editors. I've personally used a
similar stack in VIM/Neovim previously as well as IntelliJ — it's generally a
matter of translating the configuration and finding the right plugins.

Generally, I tend to program on macOS and the demos in this series will take
place on macOS virtual machine, everything in this series works cross-platform.

## `whoami`

I'm a Lead Developer (Full-stack) at a large company you've hopefully heard of
with ~20 years of experience programming, with an emphasis on front- and
back-end web development. I spend a significant amount of time tuning my
development environment to work for me, and hope sharing some of what I've
learned provides value to others.
